# Jobs
## Cognizant
### Senior Associate
March 2022 - June 2023
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams at Toyota, including Customer Data Science, Guest Experience and Retention, and Marketing Data Science, to develop data pipelines, models, and analyses driving key business decisions.
- Led the refinement and deployment of sentiment analysis models for freeform survey response text data, resulting in a 16% increase in accuracy when deployed in a production environment.
- Created interactive dashboards for customer survey data, integrating text analytics solutions such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights at a glance.
- Developed a high-precision lead conversion prediction model, achieving 94% accuracy, leading to improved marketing targeting and increased conversion rates.

## Chatdesk
### Data Scientist
May 2018 - April 2020
- Spearheaded data science efforts for the Trends product, driving automatic tagging and categorization of customer feedback across diverse channels, including email, chat, social, reviews, and surveys.
- Designed and implemented the machine learning backend, processing over 20 million messages, leveraging Flask, Google Cloud Platform, and AWS for efficient and scalable data processing.
- Developed and maintained inferential models for text classification using neural networks, logistic regression, and ensemble methods for 80+ companies across 15 industries, including Gap, Abercrombie, and Everlane.
- Mentored junior Data Scientists and supervised 2 interns, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.


# Projects
- Machine Translation
  - Implemented machine translation seq2seq model using Keras
- Text Summarization
  - Implemented text summarization using encoder-decoder model in Keras
- BERT Wrapper
  - Created a wrapper for huggingface models to interact natively with Sklearn Pipelines for quick spinning up of powerful NLP models
- [CNN For Sentence Classification](https://github.com/liamge/CNNSentClassification)
  - Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network for sentence classification using Pytorch and wrapped it in a Sklearn estimator so I can use their great built in functions for cross validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- [Recursive Neural Network](https://github.com/liamge/Pytorch_ReNN)
  - Masters Thesis, implemented the lesser-known Recursive Neural Network using Pytorch to see how well it performs at representing syntactic structure in word/phrase vectors.
